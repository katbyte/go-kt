// for the operator to ask; toolsets, an allow list and a deny list narrow the rest. Around every call: a panic becomes an error, empty lists go out
// as [], a line is written for each write with its credentials blanked, and a failure's words and, when asked, an answer's are cleaned of what should
// not reach a model. The tools themselves are the application's (Config).
